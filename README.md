# BusTicketingSystem
A kind of stupid DataBase made for by me trying to learn c, gonna try to evolve it. ( Of course its written in c)

# Files
The "BusTickets.c" is the main file and the "seat1.txt-seat5.txt" are the files where the reserved seats by the user are gonna be stored. "name1.txt-name5.txt" is where the name of the person that is written is stored and its aligned in same array element with the seat files. The number after "seat" and "name" are the bus numbers.
