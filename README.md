# BusTicketingSystem
A kind of stupid DataBase made for by me trying to learn c, gonna try to evolve it. ( Of course its written in c)

# Files
The "main.c" is the main file and the "name1.txt-name5.txt" is where the name of the person who booked a ticket is saved.

# Important Note
Files shouldn't be saved manually, this will break the whole program and some Important things.
